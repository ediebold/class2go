                    <p> A simple way to tokenize a document is to split on any
                    non-alphabetical character.  However, this sometimes has the
                    undesirable consequence of removing any numerical information.  Use
                    the unix command line utilities to find the number of tokens in the
                    following excerpt from a Wikipedia article on Astronomical Units
                    (AUs), splitting on all non-alpha-numericalcharacters:<br>
                    <br> <b> The AU was originally defined as the length of the semi-major
                    axis of the Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun. In 1976 the
                    International Astronomical Union revised the definition of the AU for
                    greater precision, defining it as that length for which the Gaussian
                    gravitational constant (k) takes the value 0.017 202 098 95 when the
                    units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and
                    time.[5][6][7] An equivalent definition is the radius of an
                    unperturbed circular Newtonian orbit about the Sun of a particle
                    having infinitesimal mass, moving with an angular frequency of 0.017
                    202 098 95 radians per day,[2] or that length for which the
                    heliocentric gravitational constant (the product GM) is equal to
                    (0.017 202 098 95)2 AU3/d2. It is approximately equal to the mean
                    Earth-Sun distance. </b>

                    <br> <br> Take special care to avoid treating two consecutive
                    non-alpha-numerical characters as delimiting an empty token (see the
                    <code>-s</code> flag for <code>tr</code>)		    </p>

			<p>You should be using the utilities <code>tr</code> and
					<code>wc</code>.  In general the manual page is your best friend
			for problems like these.  At a unix-like command line type: <br /> <br />

			First, download or copy the file: <br /><br />
			$ wget INSERT LINK TO FILE HERE <br /> <br />
			
			Then, for the BSD version of <code>tr</code> the following code should
			work: <br /> <br />
			
			$ tr -sc '[:alnum:]' '\n' < au.txt | wc -l
